# Crypton-1
Encryption &amp; Decryption Software

Crypton-1 is a encryption/decryption software that is capable of doing these 2 specific jobs with AES method.

What is AES?
-------------
AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a widely-used symmetric encryption method. It uses a fixed-length key to encrypt and decrypt data. The key is used to create a specific mathematical transformation on the data, and the same transformation can be applied in reverse to decrypt the data.

AES uses a block cipher algorithm, which means it encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (128 bits). It also supports different key sizes, including 128, 192, and 256 bits.

AES uses a technique called substitution-permutation network (SPN) for encryption. In the encryption process, the plaintext is first divided into blocks and then each block is transformed by a series of mathematical operations, such as substitution, permutation, and key mixing. In the decryption process, the ciphertext is transformed back into plaintext by applying the inverse operations in reverse order.

About Crypton-1
-----------------
The program has a basic UI developed with tkinter library. You can perform these operations we referred before by using this UI.
There are instructions in the UI explaining how to use the software.
